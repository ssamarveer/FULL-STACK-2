# Redux Post Hub

Build a React Redux Toolkit State Management Demo

Create a modern React web application that demonstrates centralized state management using Redux Toolkit and React-Redux.

Project Goal

Build a simple "Post Management Dashboard" where users can view, add, edit, and delete posts while managing application state through Redux Toolkit instead of local component state.

Tech Stack

React.js (latest)

Redux Toolkit

3. Platform Management

Maintain a separate Redux slice for platforms.

4. Redux Store

Create a Redux store using configureStore().

Create two slices:

postsSlice

State:

{

deletePost

toggleStatus

clearPosts

platformSlice

State:

{
  platforms: []
}

7. UI Design

9. Sample Data

Create at least five sample posts.

Example:

React Basics

Redux Toolkit Guide

JavaScript Tips

CSS Grid Layout

AI and Machine Learning

Each should have different platforms and statuses.

10. Optional Async Feature

Implement a mock API using createAsyncThunk().

Create:

fetchPosts()

Show:

Loading spinner

Error message

Successfully loaded posts

11. Code Quality

Use functional components only.

Follow React best practices.

Keep code modular.

Comment important sections.

Use clean variable names.

12. Final Deliverable

Generate a fully working React project that includes:

Complete source code

Redux Toolkit implementation

Responsive UI

CRUD operations

Mock API support

Proper folder structure

Ready to run using:

npm install
npm start


The final application should look like a professional admin dashboard suitable for a college practical demonstration.

This project is a standalone React and TanStack Start application for managing posts and publishing platforms.

## Development

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the app locally with `npm run dev`
- Build for production with `npm run build`

## Development

Prefer working locally? You need Node.js and npm — [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```sh
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm i
npm run dev
```
